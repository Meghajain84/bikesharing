## Summary:
The bike rental business should flourish in urban cities where people go to work and it shoudl flourish in touristy place with casual renters. Also, if working male population is more in Des Moines, it would surely be very profitable business.

Two recomendations:
* The bar chart of the distance between startlatitude/longitude and end latitude/longitude would be helpful to analyze the popularity of bike rental based on distance.
* The pie chart of rental count based on age will help in determining the business in Des Moines as well.
